WORKING

1. The Arduino reads the battery voltage through the analog input (A0).

2. The ADC (10-bit resolution) converts the analog voltage into a digital value (0–1023).

3. The measured voltage is calculated using the 5V reference.

4. The voltage is mapped between: 4.2V → 100% (fully charged)
3.2V → 0% (safe minimum)

5. The calculated battery percentage is displayed via Serial Monitor.


Connect The batter positive to (A0) Pin in Aurdino and Negative to the (GND) Pin 
afterwards upload the Code in the Aurdino and read the Percentage in (Serial monitor) Avaliable in the Aurdino IDE application.
Make sure to disconnect all probes after the Practical.


Applications

1. This system can be integrated into:
2. Portable Arduino projects
3. Battery-powered IoT systems
4. DIY speakers
5. Robotics projects
6. Power monitoring systems
7. Low-voltage protection circuits
8. It allows developers to:
9. Prevent deep discharge
10. Improve battery life
11. Monitor system power status
12. Trigger automatic shutdown below safe voltage




PURPOSE
This project implements a real-time battery voltage monitoring system using the Arduino Uno. The system reads the 
voltage of a single-cell (3.7V) Li-ion battery and converts the measured voltage into an estimated percentage (0–100%).


It provides a simple and effective way to track remaining battery capacity in embedded systems.
